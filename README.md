Custom CNN Image Classification for CT-Kidney Dataset

Overview

This repository contains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for image classification using the CT-kidney dataset. The CNN is trained to classify kidney images into predefined categories, leveraging deep learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

Dataset

The CT-kidney dataset used in this project consists of a collection of kidney images obtained from CT scans. Each image in the dataset is labeled with the corresponding class, facilitating supervised learning for image classification tasks.
